0.7.9 * Base64 and Quoted Printable encoding added

      * Attachment description is included now, too

      * Updated documentation


0.7.8 * Included MIME support. You can choose a MIME type for your body

      * Many new functions concerning MIME support added

      * MIME stuff still not quite reliable. Limitations: can't encode in
        base64 or quoted printable ATM. Please read doc/MIME.

0.7.7 * This is a total rewrite

      * Everything is better now. Really. :)

      * Project hosted on libsmtp.berlios.de now

      * Docmentation is quite good now, see doc/API

      * Support for multiple recipients

      * Support for Carbon Copy and Blind Carbon Copy

      * I guess its thread-safe now

      * Hooks for TSL there
 
      * The project is under the LGPL now


0.7.5 * Cleaned up the code, many small bugs fixed
    
    * Integrated code cleanups and optimizations from Sean Reifschneider
    <jafo@tummy.com>. Thanks!
    
    * Tested on NetBSD
    
    * Integrated handling of 8 bit data. Now if a server can't handle 8bit
      data, the function just fails, otherwise it is transmitted correctly.
      
    * Functions that check for 8 bit user data added.
    
    * Functions that output error strings added (sorta strerr)
    
    * Test application added. Sends me a mail. Beware!
    
    * Some changes to the tracelog code to don't overwrite the end of
      the string. But I'm not quite sure this is right, so you better
      choose larger tracelogs (about 2k should suffice)

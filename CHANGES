0.8.5 * Bugfix: Missing end-of-line because it was embedded in quotes in mime/comm.c,
	affecting MIME header generation. Thanks to Vladimir Pycha <Vladimir.Pycha@seznam.cz>
	for pointing it out!
      * Various bugs in bitwise OR'ing (rather embarrasing, but I was young and needed the code ;)
	and an assignment related bug fixed in smtp/libsmtp_connection.c. Thanks again to Vladimir Pycha
      * A big slew of bugfixes and style updates by Jesus Corrius
	<jesus@softcatala.org>. Thanks!

0.8.1  Thanks to an anonymous code donator on Berlios:
       * Added "extern "C" to headers
       * fixed configure, make, install a bit. Should work better now


0.8.0 * Base64 encoding can only send data chunks that are of a size of a
        multiple of 3, except for the last chunk of a part.
        Added this to the readme and added a check to the
        send_part function

      * Date added to headers, thanks to Gleen Salmon for the patch

      * A few SMTP commands ended with a LF only, added CR too. This
        caused agony for some mailserver like Lotus Domino. ~Thanks to
        an anonymous berlios member ;)


0.7.9 * Base64 and Quoted Printable encoding added

      * Attachment description is included now, too

      * Updated documentation


0.7.9b2 * Better examples added (sample generic mail client)

        * Updated documentation

        * Nasty bug in Recipient handling squashed

        * Some memory leaks fixed - probably more around

0.7.9b1 * Base64 and Quoted Printable encoding added

        * Attachment description is included now, too

        * Updated documentation

0.7.8 * Included MIME support. You can choose a MIME type for your body

      * Many new functions concerning MIME support added

      * MIME stuff still not quite reliable. Limitations: can't encode in
        base64 or quoted printable ATM. Please read doc/MIME.

0.7.7 * This is a total rewrite

      * Everything is better now. Really. :)

      * Project hosted on libsmtp.berlios.de now

      * Docmentation is quite good now, see doc/API

      * Support for multiple recipients

      * Support for Carbon Copy and Blind Carbon Copy

      * I guess its thread-safe now

      * Hooks for TSL there
 
      * The project is under the LGPL now


0.7.5 * Cleaned up the code, many small bugs fixed
    
    * Integrated code cleanups and optimizations from Sean Reifschneider
    <jafo@tummy.com>. Thanks!
    
    * Tested on NetBSD
    
    * Integrated handling of 8 bit data. Now if a server can't handle 8bit
      data, the function just fails, otherwise it is transmitted correctly.
      
    * Functions that check for 8 bit user data added.
    
    * Functions that output error strings added (sorta strerr)
    
    * Test application added. Sends me a mail. Beware!
    
    * Some changes to the tracelog code to don't overwrite the end of
      the string. But I'm not quite sure this is right, so you better
      choose larger tracelogs (about 2k should suffice)
    

0.7 Initial release

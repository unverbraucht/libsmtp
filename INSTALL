Thanks to all the nice people who helped me in my struggle with autoconf in
the time the project was rotting on Berlios. Compilation now takes

./configure
make

Then, as root:
make install

This will not install the examples (found in the examples folder). The "testapp"
application demonstrates the use of libsmtp. You should adjust the mailserver
address in "testapp.c" otherwise your mail will just be rejected. You can send
to the addresses that are preconfigured in testapp.c if you like, they are sorted
by my procmail and get thrown away, so don't worry. If you like, you can set a 
funny email (or your email address) in the From:-field, and my procmail script
will save them. Maybe I'll create a gallery someday :)

The mimetest and multiparttest are demo apps for the new MIME stuff in
libsmtp. They work for me, but might blow your coffee machine against your
invaluable tea china. Well I never! Please bear in mind that the MIME stuff
is developmental code.

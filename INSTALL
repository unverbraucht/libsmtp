I think autoconf is above me. If anybody can help me with this, I might send
him some non-virtual beer!! I must admit I'm far too lazy to get myself
mired in autoconf docs at the moment. For now, you'll have to do the following
steps to compile libsmtp:

1) ./configure
   Ignore all the error messages :)

2) cd smtp

3) make
   Hold your breath now...

4) cd ../mime

5) make

Now its up to you to do the rest, like copying the library to anyplace where
its useful, i.e. /usr/lib. The "testapp" application demonstrates the use of
libsmtp. You should adjust the mailserver address in "testapp.c" otherwise
your mail will just be rejected. You can send to the addresses that are
preconfigured in testapp.c if you like, they are sorted by my procmail and
get thrown away, so don't worry. If you like, you can set a funny email (or
your email address) in the From:-field, and my procmail script will save
them. Maybe I'll create a gallery someday :)

The mimetest and multiparttest are demo apps for the new MIME stuff in
libsmtp. They work for me, but might blow your coffee machine against your
invaluable tea china. Well I never! Please bear in mind that the MIME stuff
is developmental code.

All these examples rely on a host called mail that accepts mail from you. If
this is not the case then please change the occurence of the word "mail" to
the hostname of your mailserver, i.e. in smtpmail.c

  if (libsmtp_connect ("mail", 0, 0, mailsession))

change it to

  if (libsmtp_connect ("mail.myprovider.com", 0, 0, mailsession))

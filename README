NOTICE:
This project has been rescued over from now-defunct berlios.de and is from 2001. It
might or might not still work.

libsmtp enables developers to send mail directly via SMTP from a program.
It is designed to be flexible, easy to use and have a small code size (embedded linux)
and is licensed under the LGPL, so it can be included within closed sourced
applications, too. libsmtp has been tested under Linux and NetBSD, but
should compile on all recent Unixes and maybe even Windows.

It can send mail to multiple recipients in one go, and supports sending to CC and
BCC recipients too. The development version has (wobbly) support for
attachments (this being multiple body parts), different character sets and transport encodings.

This is a small C library that allow direct SMTP connections conforming to
RFC 822. It is designed for security and simplicity. It is a complete
rewrite of libsmtp-0.7.5, and bears no similarity to it. Libsmtp is designed
to be small enough to be used in an embedded environment, and flexible
enough to be used as underlying communications infrastructure even for MTAs
(though it is still a bit away from that goal at the moment). It is
licensed under the LGPL, which means it can be used in closed source
programs, too.

You can find updates at http://libsmtp.berlios.de

Please note that this a development version. Please read the BUGS and TODO
files in the doc directory. The next stable release will be 0.8.
libsmtp-0.7.5 and below are deprecated.

See the file doc/API and doc/MIME for programming information. The source code
and the test application are quite freely documented, too. Any patches, bug
reports and fixes and general comments welcome. Mailing list, forum, patch
manager etc. are at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/libsmtp/

Berlios is great!! Its sorta like sourceforge.net, but I like it because it
isn't so crowded :)

This is a small C library that allow direct SMTP connections conforming to
RFC 822. It is designed for security and simplicity. It has tracelog
functionality (logging) and provides detailed error codes.

It doesn't support multiple recipients at the moment, though, and it could
be better documented :-)

You can find updates (eventually) at http://www.obsidian.de/software/

There are only 3 functions:


int libsmtp_errno (void)

 returns the last errno that occured in libsmtp. Useful for real debugging.


void libsmtp_set_debug (int flag, char *buffer)

 with this function you can enable the tracing or logging function. Flag
should be either 0 (off) or 1 (on). If you enable logging, you should
provide a pointer to a memory buffer of at least 4k size in buffer.


int libsmtp_sendmail (char *from, char *to, char *mailserver, char *subject, char
  *body)

 sends mail (what else ;-). The strings from and to can be in any
RFC822-compliant type, eg:

Kevin Read <kread@innnet.de>
"Kevin Read" <kread@innnet.de>
<kread@innnet.de>
kread@innnet.de

Mailserver is the mailserver to which you send mail. No option to specify
the port at the moment...

Subject should be self-explanatory

Body too, actually..

From, to and mailhost are constrained to 200 octets length each, subject to
300. I think thats the right way to do it, if you don't like it, remove it.
Use the source, luke!

It returns the libsmtp-internal error code (see the beginning of libsmtp for
details).


Have fun. Comments et al to <kread@innnet.de>
